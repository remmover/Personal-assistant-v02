Instructions for installing a personal assistant with a command line interface:

1. Open a terminal (you can press WIN+R and write "cmd" in the pop-up window called "run") or use the terminal in the code editor you use.
2. In the terminal, use the command "cd" + the path to the root directory of personal_assistant, separated by a space, to move to the folder with the program files. For example, "cd C:\Users\Legion\Documents\GitHub\personal_assistant"
3. The package is installed into the system with the command "pip install -e" (or "python setup.py install", administrator rights are required).
4. After installation, the personal_assistant package will appear in the system.
5. When the package is installed in the system, the script can be called anywhere from the console with the command "personal_assistant"
6. The console script processes command line arguments in the same way as a Python script.
